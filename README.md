# Flan's mod Plugin for Blockbench

This is a small project that aims to bring Blockbench model support to Blockbench. **It is nowhere near completion and should not yet be used!**


### Install

1. Download the blockbench_flans_plugin.js file.
2. Open Blockbench either in the browser or as desktop application
3. Click on File -> Plugins -> Load Plugin from file and select the downloaded file.
4. Create a new Flan's Mod Model and select a template which you want to use.

### Current State:

- [x] Basic export functionality
- [x] Some vehicle templates
- [ ] Implementation of meshes
- [ ] Correct texture generation
- [ ] Seat/Controls placement
- [ ] Implementation of restrictions by Flan's Mod
